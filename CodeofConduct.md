Conflict Resolution

Step 1) If you are being harassed or if you notice that someone else is being harassed please inform this person that they have affected you negatively. If you feel uncomfortable directly engaging this person please contact one of the Code for DC organizers (Matt, Justin, & Leah) to inform us of the situtation. 

Repercussions

The person engaged in harassing behavior will be asked to stop any harassing behavior. If a person engaged in harassing behavior is considered egregious or if this harassing behavior continues then organizers may take action to resolve this situation.

If an incident occurs, please use the following contact information:

Justin Grimes @justgrimes jgrimes@codeforamerica.org
Leah Bannon @leahbannon lbannon@codeforamerica.org
Matt Bailey @mattbailey0 mbailey@codeforamerica.org
