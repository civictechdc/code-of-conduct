[Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/) [Code of Conduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct)
=============

Code for DC is an organization that is about getting people together to use technology to empower people to address local issues within their local community. The goal is to foster meaningful collaboration between volunteers of Code for DC, the public, government, companies and nonprofits. Toward that goal Code for DC strives to create a safe space for all of it's events. A place where anyone can relax and fully express themselves without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcomed, or unsafe based on their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Code for DC does not tolerate harassment of any form. To achieve this Code for DC enforces an anti-harassment policy. Those violating this policy may face repercussions at the discretion of the Code for DC organizers. 

Anti-Harassment Policy 
-------------

Code for DC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone , regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. 

Harassment includes any offensive verbal or written comments relating to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion. Harassment also includes but is not limited to deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, invasion of personal space, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, unwarranted exclusion, inappropriate physical contact, physical attack, verbal threats, unwelcome sexual attention, derisory remarks, bullying, public humiliation, persistent unjustified criticism, insults or offensive jokes, intrusive questioning about a person's domestic circumstances, and patronizing language or action.

Confused about harassment?
-------------
Sometimes harassment is not clear or rather harassment is not understood to be harassment by the person exhibiting harassing behavior. For some people it may seem like there is a gray area between warm and welcoming behavior and what is unacceptable. Good conduct requires good judgment. If you are not sure if something is appropriate behavior, play it safe and assume it isn't. You are always free to talk to one of the organizers about your question. Remember it is your responsibility to realize if your behavior would have a negative impact on others.

What To Do If You Feel Harassed 
-------------
If the situation is an emergency or you feel someone is in danger contact the police (911) or security immediately then notify the Code for DC organizers.

If you are being harassed or if you notice that someone else is being harassed please inform this person that they have affected you negatively. Make it clear that you consider this behavior harassment. Do not apologize (it's not your fault) but remember to attack the behavior (not the person). Also please inform organizers of the situation so that we have documentation of the incident (e.g. people involved, time of incident, behavior or circumstances surrounding the incident). Documentation helps us to resolve the issue. Regardless of how you choose to proceed we will always respect your privacy. 

If you feel uncomfortable engaging this person please contact one of the Code for DC organizers ([Matt](mailto:mbailey@codeforamerica.org), [Justin](mailto:jgrimes@codeforamerica.org), & [Leah](mailto:lbannon@codeforamerica.org)) to inform us of the situation.
